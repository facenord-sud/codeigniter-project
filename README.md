###A codeigniter project for manging student groups, school documents (upload/downlaod, listing) and book announces

Never finished project, because we discovered Ruby on Rails. This project became a little buggy and not very well coded, too. This repo is to show what to not do, give inspiration for certain part of coding (espacially codeigniter configuration) and to save somewhere all this code.

By the way, this project includes many features:

* home made orm
* representing data as tree in the sql database. Using the intervallic representation
* Ability to transalte table in database
* twigg
* foundation and saas
* very cusotmized configuration
* routing rebundeld
* translation including routes transalation
* codeigniter bugs correction, espacially in routing
* refactirung of many codeigniter functions (link_to, redirect). Maybe not that good.
* unit tests with simple_test. Configuring phpunit test was to hard...

Maybe other thigns but I forget it.

####Seriousely, never start a quite big project with codeigniter. Ruby on Rails or other web framworks are better for that (django, flask, sinatra, jersey).

And an orm already exist for codeigniter. It should be better than mine.
